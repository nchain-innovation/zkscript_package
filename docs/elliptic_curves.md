# Elliptic curve arithmetic

The zk Script Library contains the implementation of arithmetic for elliptic curves. More precisely, it contains scripts for:
- EC arithmetic over a prime field `Fq`:
    - `point_addition`: a script to sum two points that we know are not equal, nor the inverse of one another
    - `point_doubling`: a script to double a point
    - `point_addition_with_unknown_points`: a script to sum two points which we do not know whether they are equal, different, or the inverse of one another
- Unrolled EC arithmetic over a prime field `Fq`: `unrolled_multiplication` returns a script to compute the scalar point multiplication `a * P` for any point `P` and any `a` which is smaller that the `max_multiplier` parameter supplied to the `unrolled_multiplication` function when the script was constructed
- EC arithmetic over a quadratic extension field `Fq2`:
    - `point_addition`
    - `point_doubling`
    - `point_negation`

 In all the implementations, the point at infinity is modelled as a sequence of `0x00`, as many as the number of elements required to specify a point on the curve. E.g, `0x00 0x00` is the point at infinity in a curve over `Fq`, `0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00` is the point at infinity in a curve over `Fq2`.

 Below are some examples of how to use the above scripts.

# EC arithmetic over Fq2

`ec_operations_fq2` work in the same way as per `ec_operations_fq`, with the difference that when we instantiate an object of the class `ElliptiCurveFq2` we need to supply the instantiation of the Bitcoin Script arithmetic in `Fq2`.

The other difference between `ElliptiCurveFq`and `ElliptiCurveFq2`is that the methods `point_addition` and `point_doubling` of the latter take a few additional arguments. Namely:
- `point_addition` takes the arguments: `position_lambda`, `position_P` and `position_Q`, which are the positions in the stack of the elements `P` and `Q` that are being summed, and the position of the gradient between them. Thanks to these arguments, the script is able to pick `P`, `Q` and the gradient without the user preparing the stack beforehand.
- `point_doubling` takes the arguments: `position_lambda` and `position_P`, which are the positions in the stack of the element `P` that is being doubled, and the position of the gradient of the line tangent to the curve at `P`. Thanks to these arguments, the script is able to pick `P` and the gradient without the user preparing the stack beforehand.

# Unrolled EC arithmetic

`EllipticCurveFqUnrolled` is a class that allows us to compute scalar point multiplication over any curve over a prime field. The function producing such script is `unrolled_multiplication`, which takes the following variables:
- `max_multiplier`: the max number `n` such that the script is able to compute `n * P`
- `modulo_threshold`: the max size a number is allowed to reach during script execution
- `check_constant`: a boolean value deciding whether the script should check that the constant supplied for modulo operations is correct
- `clean_constant`: a boolean value deciding whether the script should clean the constant used for modulo operations

The data needed to execute the output script of `unrolled_multiplication` is described in the function documentation. It works as follows: `q ... marker_a_is_zero [lamdbas,a] P`, where:
- `q` is the modulus used to perform modulo operations
- `marker_a_is_zero` is a marker which is set to `Ã’P_1` if `a=0`, to `OP_0` otherwise
- `P` is the point we are multiplying by
- `[lambdas,a]` is the sequence of gradients (also called lamdbdas) needed to compute `a * P`, together with some flags used by the script to detect which operations to perform. The construction of the unlocking script can be seen in the function `unrolled_multiplication_input`; some examples are also given in the `unrolled_multiplication` function documentation.

Note that the script computes `a * P` via double-and-add, i.e., it goes down from `a_(n-2)` to `a_0`, where `a = a_0 ... a_(n-1)` in binary and doubles and add at each step according to `a_i`.
