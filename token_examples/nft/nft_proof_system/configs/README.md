# Configs

The configuration files contained in these subfolders have been used to generate the proofs for the transaction chain starting at `4857fbb2da973cab3a42cf42bc705b56a8748d2ea0fa1527abfa54021ec2f86c` with chain index `0`.

The on-chain deployment of these proofs has been talked about in 
[Trustless Revolution: Recursive Groth16 For NFTs on Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@w.zhang/trustless-revolution-how-recursive-groth16-is-disrupting-nfts-on-bitcoin-954a17fb4171).
In the blog post, you can also find the links to all the testnet transactions (the zk-verifiers, the zk-proof, and the token transfers).
